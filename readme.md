2. Download the latest release of Four Person Expeditions
3. Extract the mod folder into your game's `mods` directory
4. Enable the mod in the Mod Manager

## Usage

Start an expedition as normal. The party selection window allows up to four members. To leave a slot empty, select the "Nobody" portrait. During expeditions, use the left/right arrow keys to page between party members on the map view.

## Known Issues
